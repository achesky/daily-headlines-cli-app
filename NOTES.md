Command Line Interface for daily news headlines, pulling from the New York Times and the Washington Post

User types 'daily headlines'

** I switched to using the newspaper the Washington Post from the Wall Street Journal, because the WSJ did not post headlines for their authors on their home page.  

Outputs: 
  1 NYT
  2 WP

  Which would you like to read? 

User inputs WP or NYT

Outputs list of headlines (numbered?)

  Which story would you like to read? 

User picks a headline (by number? or by typing in headline? -- which makes sense?)

Outputs blurb + url for story

------

What's an article? 
Name 
Author
Blurb
URL

Thoughts after building out "fake" articles would be: 
  1 I'm going to decide how I want to differentiate articles from newspapers -- probably going to have to build another class

  2 At what points / waht commands I want to output the different attributes of articles

  3 What is outputted in what order?

Action Plan: 

Build it out for New York Times until it's "real"

Add in Newspaper class

Add in Washington Post articles
